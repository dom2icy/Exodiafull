# Telegram Trading Bot

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that connects to Telegram for monitoring trading signals and interfaces with Solana blockchain for automated trading. The system allows users to authenticate with Telegram, monitor channels for trading signals, and execute trades on the Solana network.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite for development (configured to support PostgreSQL via environment variables)
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for temporary data storage
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server with autoscale deployment target

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 dark theme
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS variables for Telegram-themed styling

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.11** runtime environment
- **Telethon** for Telegram API integration
- **Solana Python SDK** for blockchain interactions
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for database operations
- **Gunicorn** for production deployment

## Key Components

### 1. Telegram Integration (`telegram_monitor.py`)
- Handles Telegram API authentication using phone number verification
- Manages session strings for persistent connections
- Monitors channels for trading signals
- Implements error handling for various Telegram API exceptions

### 2. Solana Blockchain Client (`solana_client.py`)
- Creates and manages Solana wallets
- Handles balance queries and transaction execution
- Configurable RPC endpoint (defaults to devnet)
- Wallet creation and management functionality

### 3. Database Models (`models.py`)
- **TelegramConnection**: Stores Telegram authentication data
- **SolanaWallet**: Manages Solana wallet information
- **TradingSignal**: Records detected trading signals from channels
- **TradeExecution**: Tracks executed trades (model incomplete in current code)

### 4. Web Interface
- **Landing Page**: Telegram connection setup and authentication
- **Dashboard**: Main trading interface (basic structure)
- **Real-time Status Updates**: JavaScript-based connection monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users provide Telegram API credentials and phone number
2. **Telegram Connection**: System establishes connection and handles 2FA verification
3. **Channel Monitoring**: Connected client monitors specified channels for trading signals
4. **Signal Processing**: Messages are parsed and stored as trading signals
5. **Trade Execution**: Signals trigger automated trades on Solana network
6. **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback provided through web interface

## External Dependencies

### Telegram API
- Requires API ID and API Hash from my.telegram.org
- Phone number verification for authentication
- Session string management for persistent connections

### Solana Network
- Configurable RPC endpoint (devnet/mainnet)
- Wallet management and transaction execution
- Balance monitoring and trade execution

### Database
- SQLite for development
- PostgreSQL support configured for production
- Automatic table creation on startup

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- SQLite database for local development
- Gunicorn with reload for development server
- Debug logging enabled

### Production
- Autoscale deployment target configured
- PostgreSQL database via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- ProxyFix middleware for proper header handling
- Session secret from environment variables

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session encryption key
- `SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT`: Solana network endpoint

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Always keep verification code input visible - don't hide/show modals.
No test mode - only real Telegram API integration.
